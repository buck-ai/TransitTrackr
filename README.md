### Project Title: 
**TransitTrackr** - A Real-Time Public Transport Tracking Application

### Project Description:
TransitTrackr will be a web application that allows users to track the real-time locations of public transportation vehicles, such as buses or trains, in a specified city or area. Users will be able to view the vehicles on a map, see estimated arrival times, and get updates on delays or cancellations.

### Core Features:
1. **Real-time Location Updates:** Display live locations of buses/trains on a map.
2. **Route Information:** Show detailed routes with stops for each vehicle.
3. **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for specific routes or stops.
4. **User Authentication:** Enable users to create accounts and save favorite routes.
5. **Notifications:** Send alerts about delays, cancellations, or arrival times.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** React.js (with Hooks and Context API for state management)
  - **Mapping Library:** Leaflet.js or Google Maps API for rendering interactive maps
  - **Styling:** Styled-Components or Sass for custom styles
  - **Testing:** Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing
- **Backend (A Template will be provided) :**
  - **Language:** Node.js
  - **Framework:** Express.js for handling API requests
  - **WebSocket Library:** Socket.IO for WebSocket connection
  - **Database:** MongoDB for storing route and user data
  - **Authentication:** Passport.js for user authentication
  - **Testing:** Mocha and Chai for API testing
- **DevOps:**
  - **Containerization:** Docker for containerizing the application
  - **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
  - **Web Server:** NGINX as a reverse proxy and for serving static files
- **Others:**
  - **Version Control:** Git with GitHub as a remote repository
  - **Package Manager:** npm or Yarn
  - **Code Linting:** ESLint
  - **Code Formatting:** Prettier

### RESTful API Usage:
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/routes`: Retrieve a list of all routes with basic details.
  - `GET /api/routes/{id}`: Get detailed information about a specific route.
  - `POST /api/users/register`: Handle user registration.
  - `POST /api/users/login`: Handle user login and authentication.
  - `GET /api/users/favorites`: Fetch user's saved favorite routes (requires auth).
  - `POST /api/users/favorites`: Add a new favorite route for the user (requires auth).

### WebSocket Usage:
- **Functionality:**
  - After a user connects to the application, establish a WebSocket connection using Socket.IO.
  - Subscribe the user to updates for specific routes or general updates.
  - Emit events to the client with the latest location data for vehicles at a set interval (e.g., every 10 seconds) or whenever a significant location change occurs.
  - Handle `disconnect` events when a user leaves the application and clean up any listeners related to that user's session.

### Instructions for WebSocket Implementation:
1. **Server-Side (Node.js/Express.js/Socket.IO):**
   - Set up a Socket.IO server that integrates with your existing Express.js server.
   - Define events for connection, disconnection, and to emit vehicle location updates.
   - Connect to the database or an external API to get real-time location data.
   - Broadcast location updates to all connected clients or specific rooms that represent different routes.

2. **Client-Side (React.js/Socket.IO Client):**
   - Use the Socket.IO client library to establish a connection to the server.
   - Listen for location update events and update the state accordingly to re-render the map components with the new locations.
   - Implement cleanup logic using React's useEffect hook to disconnect the WebSocket connection when the component unmounts.

### Instructions for RESTful API Implementation:
1. **Server-Side:**
   - Design and implement RESTful endpoints following best practices.
   - Include middleware for authentication and error handling.
   - Ensure responses are correctly structured and HTTP status codes are used appropriately.

2. **Client-Side:**
   - Use a library like Axios or Fetch API to make requests to the RESTful API endpoints.
   - Handle the data received from the API to display route information.
   - Implement state management to handle the data received and to manage user sessions.

### Deliverables:
- Source code for both the front-end and back-end.
- Documentation, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and WebSocket events.
- A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization.
- Automated tests for both the front-end and back-end.

### Additional Notes:
- Security considerations such as HTTPS, CORS policy, and WebSocket security must be addressed.
- Scalability should be considered - how the app will handle a large number of concurrent users.
- The UI should be responsive, providing a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
